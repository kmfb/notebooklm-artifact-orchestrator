# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories or direct maintainer contact.
Do not open public issues for active secret exposures.

## Scope

In scope:
- hardcoded credentials / IDs / secrets
- unsafe default paths leaking local/private data
- packaging behavior that could include unintended files

## Safe disclosure expectations

Include:
- affected file path(s)
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- suggested patch (optional)

We will acknowledge and triage as quickly as possible.
